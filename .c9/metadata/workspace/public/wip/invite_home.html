It is a gift&hellip;\n\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\" style=\"font-size:18pt;\">\n\n\t\t\t\tHave you ever opened an expensive box of chocolates? </p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">First there's searching for the strip to break into the smooth, glossy shrinkwrap, then feeling for the tabs to open the cardboard lid. Usually there's a layer of light corrugated card to lift up underneath which each chocolate sits in its own unique shape on the carefully moulded tray. Some chocolates are individually wrapped in foil, each embossed with their own patterns, and of course there's the little instruction booklet too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">All of those things add to the pleasure and experience of eating the chocolate&mdash;it's such a different experience than putting your fingers into a bag of minstrels. </p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">It's both a tactile and visual experience which delights your senses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">Wouldn't it be great if your guests could feel the same delight when opening your invitations?</p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">It's that feeling we, of anticipation and delight, that we set about to create with our invitations&hellip;</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/invite_vellum.png\" style=\"display:block;margin:0 auto;width:505px;\" />\n\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">First there's the matching envelopes individually handcrafted just for your order&mdash;and when I say matching, I don't just mean the colour of the envelope: each envelope is fully printed inside and out with the same design as your invitations, making them stand out from the sea of standard plain white envelopes that hold most other designs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">Inside you'll find an invitation dressed in one of a range of embellishments to add that wow factor:</p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">Whether it's uwrapping the paper sleeve adorned with your monogram, unbuckling the gently glinting diamante ribbon or untying the bow, your guests will feel like they're discovering something really special. </p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/ribbon.png\" style=\"padding:0.5em;display:inline-block;width:225px;text-align:center;\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/wrap.png\" style=\"padding:0.5em;display:inline-block;width:225px;text-align:center;\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/pearl.png\" style=\"padding:0.5em;display:inline-block;width:225px;text-align:center;\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">Not to mention the delicate, frosted vellum cover, again watermarked with your monogram in a matching design, that evokes a feeling of exclusivity than card alone cannot match.</p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">And the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance: the beautifully printed tissue paper, light as a feather, used to separate any inserts such as RSVP cards or information sheets that may be enclosed with your invitation. If you opt for a box envelope (read more in a bit...) then these are layered either side of your invitation card: it really does feel like opening a box containing an expensive pair of designer shoes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">And not only does the tissue paper add an angelic beauty, it also serves the practical function of preventing the ink imprinting during transit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">But to really know a good invitation, you need to know what makes a bad invitation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">So let's take a look at some of the biggest mistakes&hellip;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<!--------------------------  BENEFIT ------->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"margin-top:0.5em;background-color:#F1EFF0;\"> <img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/diamond.svg\"

packaging is as important as the gift inside&hellip;\n\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p class=\"benefit\" style=\"font-size:18pt;\">\n\tNothing lets a good invitation down like a bad envelope:\n</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">\n\t\t\t\t\nisn't there something satisfying about opening a perfectly-wrapped present, tied with a bow and adorned with a tag?</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">\nThat's why companies spend millions of pounds wrapping boring things like rice in elegant, carefully-designed foil (and shoving an extra Â£1 on the price in the process!).</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">\nNeedless to say, boring, plain envelopes with smudged, hand-scribbled addresses will not do justice to what is inside.</p>\n\t<img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/envelope.png\" style=\"margin:0 auto;width:700px;display:block;;\" />\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">\nThe envelope is the first thing your guests will see and when it arrives through the letterbox you want them to be impressed and excited to find out what's inside, not think it's another badly-written birthday card from Aunty Emily or a bill from British Gas.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">\nWhen people see our invitations for the first time, it's usually the envelope that they are first surprised and impressed with. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">\nWhy?</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">\nBecause our highly tailored envelopes are simply so rare to see: printed both inside and out with matching intricate designs that compliment the invitations they contain and personalised with your own monogram, each envelope can also be individually printed with your guest addresses for the ultimate in co-ordination (not forgetting saving you a lot of time). </p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">\nAnd it's because envelopes are wrongly the least considered element of a wedding invitation that our high level of customisation really does make your invitation stand out: everyone is so used to boring envelopes that it's a real surprise to see something so beautiful&mdash;your invitations will be the talk of your guests who will be asking \"Where did you get these made?\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">\nIf you want to go one step further, our box envelopes really do make your guests feel as though they are receiving an expensive present (they're just like little presentation box), a gift they simply won't be able to throw away. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t<!--------------------------  BENEFIT ------->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"margin-top:0.5em;background-color:#F1EFF0;\"> <img

class=\"benefit\">They are handled by at least a dozen different people, pressed between rollers, rained-upon and X-rayed&mdash;just for starters. </p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">All of this means that there without careful consideration, your invitation may well not arrive in the same state you posted it in. </p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">One bride was devastated to find that when her guests received her invitation, the ink had transferred to the other side of the card, causing a horrible, smudged, ghosting effect. </p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">Yet another was very unhappy because the seal on her envelopes was so flimsy that half of them had come open in the post, spilling her RSVP cards and enclosures into oblivion. </p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">Another common issue is Fat Envelope Syndrome&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/box_envelope.png\" style=\"margin:0 auto;width:550px;display:block;;\" />\n\n\t\t\t<p

They are meant for flat cards only.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">Added extras will give the envelope a horrible, unsightly bulge, you won't be able to seal them neatly, and to top it off when they are in the post, the knot on the ribbon or the envelope will often get pushed against the envelope so hard that it will actually cause the envelope to rip and can end up poking through.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">Diamantes can press against other enclosures as well as the envelope causing unsightly scars and indents. </p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">Rain will often cause handwritten addresses to run if you use soluble ink, and the same can go for ink printed with inkjets. </p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">This isn't how you want your invitation to arrive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">You'd be surprised how many stationery companies have never actually posted different combinations of their own invitations to find out what state they arrive in!</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">But I have. I know all the nasty things that can happen to an invitation in transit and so I design everything to make that journey as safe as it can be.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">Our box-envelopes, made from sturdy matching card, are created especially to hold invitations with added extras and keep them in pristine condition.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">Our tissue paper not only looks stunning, but acts as a seperator between cards to prevent ink transferring during transit.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">Our waterproof vellum covers protect your invitation in the event that even the smallest bit of rain gets in. </p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">And our wax ink will never run or smudge because water can't damage it. </p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">Take that, postman!</p>\n\n\t\t<!--------------------------  BENEFIT ------->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"margin-top:0.5em;background-color:#F1EFF0;\"> <img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/diamond.svg\" style=\"padding-top:1em;display:block;margin:0 auto;padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom:0;width:45px;\" /></div><img src=\"/gfx/triangle.svg\" style=\"margin:0 auto;padding:0;display:block;\" />\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\" style=\"padding-top:0;margin-top:0;text-align:center;font-family:GaraI;line-height:1.2em;font-size:24pt;padding-bottom:0.5em;margin-top:0;width:70%;border-bottom:1px solid black;\">\n\t\t\t\tPersonalisation will save you many hours of valuable time and stress&hellip;\n\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p class=\"benefit\" style=\"font-size:18pt;\">\nHave you any idea how long it takes to individually address each invitation and envelope?\n</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\">It's probably something you haven't thought too hard about... but handwriting guest names on each invitation is a messy, time consuming , physically demanding and error prone business&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">Your hand will ache after a while and the beautiful handwriting you inscribed on the first invitation will start looking like a Doctor's signature by invitation number 32.</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">And there's no delete button when you mess up the spelling, and oh dear, now your invitation is ruined as the name won't fit in the space!</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">If you're going to personalise your invitations by hand, then you need to be prepared to order a good few extra envelopes and invitations as you're going to screw up some of them. It's a fact. </p>\n\n\t<img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/guestname.png\" style=\"margin:0 auto;width:250px;display:block;;\" />\n\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">Plus, ink smudges easily, and in the words of one of our brides, \"I just don't like the look of a perfect printed invitation and then hand written names\".</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">But there's a simple solution:</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">We can print your guest names on each invitation individually, as well as addressing your envelopes (more info below):</p>\n\n\t<img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/guestaddress.png\" style=\"margin:0 auto;width:400px;display:block;;\" />\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">not only does it look much nicer to have an invitation co-ordinated with pre-printed names in a matching font, but creating a list you can edit and update on a computer first is much more sensible: you can thorougly check for mistakes, and, if you intend to handwrite your envelopes you're going to have to create a list of names and addresses anyway&mdash; so why, when you've already created the list, double the amount of time and effort by rewriting these all out when they can just be emailed to us for printing?</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">But it's about more than just saving time&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">Personalisation is extremely important because by explicitly addressing your invitations to \"Sarah, Jane & Jenny\", it takes the guesswork away from your guests: Sarah knows straight away that she can bring her flatmate and daughter. If it just says \"Sarah & Guest\", she knows she is invited and can bring any guest.</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">An invitation that isn't personalised makes it awkward for your guests to know who they can and can't bring along (and awkward for you\nto know who they are bringing along too), but if you address your guests individually, you'll make things\neasier for yourself and your guests from the start: it avoids that difficult conversation when they ask you,\n\"Can I bring the kids/boyfriend I met last week?\".</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"benefit\">If you don't personalise your wedding invitations with individual names, it's not clear who exactly is invited--and that means more hassle for you.</p>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t<!--------------------------  BENEFIT ------->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"margin-top:0.5em;background-color:#F1EFF0;\"> <img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/diamond.svg\" style=\"padding-top:1em;display:block;margin:0 auto;padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom:0;width:45px;\" /></div><img src=\"/gfx/triangle.svg\" style=\"margin:0 auto;padding:0;display:block;\" />\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\" style=\"padding-top:0;margin-top:0;text-align:center;font-family:GaraI;line-height:1.2em;font-size:24pt;padding-bottom:0.5em;margin-top:0;width:70%;border-bottom:1px solid black;\">\n\t\t\t\tBad typography will make your invitations look like a card from Moonpig&hellip;\n\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p class=\"benefit\" style=\"font-size:18pt;\">\nWhatever you do, please, please don't let your invitation look like it was created in Microsoft Word.\n</p><p class=\"benefit\">\nNothing shouts cheap and amateur louder and looks uglier than an invitation that's been laid out by someone with no typography skills. \n</p><p class=\"benefit\">\nThere's a reason people hire graphic designers&hellip;\n</p><p class=\"benefit\">\n&hellip;sometimes when you look at something, it just looks professional, chic and expensive but if anyone was to ask you, you wouldn't be able to explain why--it's just a feeling.\n</p><p class=\"benefit\">\nBut a lot of work goes into making you have that feeling: it's all in the detail--\ncare and attention to the little nuances that, on their own don't seem very significant but combined make a\nmassive difference to the way people see and perceive your invitations--either as cheap and tacky or expensive\nand elegant.\n</p><p class=\"benefit\">\nSubtle touches such as careful alignment and spacing, the use of bullet points and ornamental separations\nbetween paragraphs are just some of the things that individually may not sound like much but together add up to create a stunning layout that you would expect from a Royal wedding.\n</p><p class=\"benefit\">\nStuff from Lidl looks and feels cheaper than the premium products at Waitrose. \n</p><p class=\"benefit\">\nThe Sun doesn't look as classy as The Times. \n</p><p class=\"benefit\">\nBut whilst you can see the difference, it takes a professional to understand what goes into making the difference. \n</p><p class=\"benefit\">\n Free fonts and clipart that have been downloaded from the internet are free for a reason: they don't have the same\nrefinements that will give your invitations a polished, superior look.</p>\n<p class=\"benefit\">\nSome of the fonts we use have cost hundreds of pounds, and we pay that because we know the time and effort went into creating them and the value they give in making your invitations look exquisite. </p>\n\n<p class=\"benefit\">\nToo many stationery suppliers are often brides with no design background who've created their own stationery and decided to make a bit of money on the side creating stationery for others.</p> \n<p class=\"benefit\" style=\"font-size:18pt;\">\n\nWhich leads me nicely onto...</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"margin-top:0.5em;background-color:#F1EFF0;\"> <img src=\"/gfx/copywriting/diamond.svg\" style=\"padding-top:1em;display:block;margin:0 auto;padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom:0;width:45px;\" /></div><img src=\"/gfx/triangle.svg\" style=\"margin:0 auto;padding:0;display:block;\" />\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"benefit\" style=\"padding-top:0;margin-top:0;text-align:center;font-family:GaraI;line-height:1.2em;font-size:24pt;padding-bottom:0.5em;margin-top:0;width:70%;border-bottom:1px solid black;\">\n\t\t\tDon't underestimate the time, energy and money you'll waste trying to do it yourselfl&hellip;\n\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"benefit\" style=\"font-size:18pt;\">\n            Have you ever done a simple DIY job around the house that's turned into a large DIY job that's ended up costing you more in time, money and frustration than if you'd just paid a professional to do it?\n            </p><p class=\"benefit\">\nIf so, then you'll know that often \"doing it yourself\" can be a false economy.
