Too many brides wrongly underestimate the importance of invitations when it comes to their big day: or they focus too much on what their invitations look like without thinking about the practical purpose they serve. Picture the scene&hellips;","","\t\t\t\t\tI don&lsquo;t need to tell you that you&lsquo;re judged on appearance every day: that&lsquo;s life.","","Yet when planning a wedding, so many people risk giving their special day a bad first impression with poorly-chosen, unprofessional stationery:","","\t\t&hellip;would you wear an ill-fitting, badly-sewn wedding dress? No. Yet just like your clothes, you&lsquo;ll be judged on the quality of your invitations&mdash;it&lsquo;s the first chance guests will have to form an opinion about your big day if","\t\t\t\t\tit&lsquo;s something for them to get excited about. Opening an invitation should feel like opening a special gift: that's why it&lsquo;s important that you get it right.","\t\t\t\t\t","THE PACKAGING IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE GIFT INSIDE","================================================","","","\tWhen choosing your invitation, how it looks is usually the first thing you will think about, but remember! Beauty is only skin deep&mdash; invitations are there to serve many practical purposes&mdash;not just to impress your guests, but also to make your","\t\t\t\t\tlife easier&mdash; yet most people foolishly overlook this as they're too consumed with aesthetics. So ask yourself, what should a good wedding invitation achieve?","\t\t\t","\t\t\tPERSONLISATION","=============","","Personalisation is the future. By explicitly addressing your invitations to \"Sarah, Jane & Jenny\", it takes the guesswork away from your guests: Sarah knows straight away that she can bring her flatmate and daughter. If it just says \"Sarah & Guest\", she knows she is invited and can bring any guest. An invitation that isn'tpersonalised makes it awkward for your guests to know who they can and can't bring along (and awkward for you","to know who they are bringing along too), but if you address your guests individually, you'll make things","easier for yourself and your guests from the start: it avoids that difficult conversation when they ask you,","\"Can I bring the kids/boyfriend I met last week?\".","","If you don't personalise your wedding invitations with individual names, it's not clear who exactly is invited--and that means more hassle for you.","","But handwriting guest names on each invitation is also a messy, time consuming , physically demanding (your hand will ache after a while and the beautiful handwriting you inscribed on the first invitation will start looking like a Doctor's signature by invitation number 32) and error prone (no delete button when you mess up the spelling, and oh dear, the name won't fit in the space!). ","","Ink smudges easily, and in the words of one of our brides, \"I just don't ike the look of a perfect printed invitation and then hand written names\".","","But there's a simple solution: We can print your guest names on each invitation individually, as well as addressing your envelopes (more info below): not only does it look much nicer to have an invitation co-ordinated with pre-printed names, but creating a list you can edit and update on a computer first is much more manageable. And whilst there is always the (very expensive) option of a professional calligrapher, you can also choose something called \"Handwriting fonts\" which can mimic the effect of calligraphic written names with a special font but without the expensive hassle.","","And to top it all off you can add via user interface.","","","Save time, avoid damaging the invitation by writing on envelope or card, less mistakes.","","","Important so people know who is invited!

That's why companies spend millions of pounds wrapping things like rice in elegant, carefully-designed foil (and shoving an extra £1 on the price in the process!). Needless to say, boring, plain envelopes with smudged, hand-scribbled addresses will not do justice to what is inside.The envelope is the first thing your guests will see and when it arrives through the letterbox you want them to be impressed and excited to find out what's inside, and not think it's another badly-written birthday card from Aunty Emily or a bill from British Gas.","","Envelopes are wrongly the least considered element of an invitation package: but we believe they are just as important as every other item. That's why we handmake them to order, printed inside and out with matching, intricate designs that compliment the invitations they contain, along with your chosen monogram. Each envelope can also be individually addressed with your guest names and addresses for the ultimate co-ordination. ","","Box envelopes are even better.","","","Your invitation isn't a card. It is a gift. ","========================","","Your invitations aren't council tax bills or Christmas cards&mdash;they are keepsakes for you, your family and your guests to treasure forever: something to pass down to your children and grandchildren. They're just as important as the photographs when it comes to a record of your special day.","","Opening an invitation should be like opening a gift for the guest who receives it: the honour that you have chosen them to attend your wedding is no small gesture but one of great meaning.","","Have you ever opened an expensive box of chocolates? ","","First there's the cellophane wrapping, then feeling for the tabs to open the cardboard lid. Usually there's a layer of light corrugated card to lift up underneath which each chocolate sits in its own unique shape on the carefully moulded tray. Some chocolates are individually wrapped in foil, and of course there is the little instruction booklet too. ","","All of those things add to the pleasure and experience of eating the chocolate&mdash;it's such a different experience than putting your fingers into a bag of minstrels. ","","Our invitations are the same.","","First, there is a range of embellishments to add that wow factor. Whether it's gently removing the paper wrap adorned with your monogram, removing the gently glinting diamante buckle or untying the bow, your guests will feel like they're engaging with something special. ","","Then there's the delicate, frosted vellum cover, again watermarked with your monogram in a matching design, that evokes a feeling of exclusivity than card alone cannot match.","","And the pièce de résistance: the beautifully printed tissue paper, light as a feather, used to separate any inserts such as RSVP cards or information sheets that may be enclosed with your invitation. If you opt for a box envelope (read more in a bit...) then these are layered either side of your invitation card: it really does feel like opening a box containing an expensive pair of designer shoes. ","","And not only does the tissue add an angelic beauty, it also serves the practical function of preventing the ink imprinting during transit.
