Invitation nightmares: don't make these mistakes when choosing your wedding stationery&hellip;
Don't risk these invitation nightmares when choosing your wedding stationery
If the invitation was anything to go by, then I was already dreading the actualy wedding&hellip;


INTRO 
=====

"I remember getting a homemade wedding invitation in the mail which had completely fallen apart Tthe stuck on ribbon and lace had fallen off as had the fake flower because of the cheap glue they used. The paper was cut crooked and you could see the pencil outlines they used to cut along&mdash;it just made me cringe. I couldn't believe they could send that to people&hellip; I'd be too ashamed. 
I know weddings are incredibly expensive but it really set the mood for the whole wedding. I already started to imagine how awful the actual event was going to be.
"

That's a quote from an email conversation I had with a client about 


So it's time to choose your wedding invitations&mdash; you've already got some colours and styles in mind, but have you really spent much time thinking about what you really want your invitations to achieve? Too many brides wrongly underestimate the importance of invitations when it comes to their big day: or they focus too much on what their invitations look like without thinking about the practical purpose they serve. Picture the scene&hellips;

					I don&lsquo;t need to tell you that you&lsquo;re judged on appearance every day: that&lsquo;s life.

Yet when planning a wedding, so many people risk giving their special day a bad first impression with poorly-chosen, unprofessional stationery:

		&hellip;would you wear an ill-fitting, badly-sewn wedding dress? No. Yet just like your clothes, you&lsquo;ll be judged on the quality of your invitations&mdash;it&lsquo;s the first chance guests will have to form an opinion about your big day if
					it&lsquo;s something for them to get excited about. Opening an invitation should feel like opening a special gift: that's why it&lsquo;s important that you get it right.
					
THE PACKAGING IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE GIFT INSIDE
================================================


	When choosing your invitation, how it looks is usually the first thing you will think about, but remember! Beauty is only skin deep&mdash; invitations are there to serve many practical purposes&mdash;not just to impress your guests, but also to make your
					life easier&mdash; yet most people foolishly overlook this as they're too consumed with aesthetics. So ask yourself, what should a good wedding invitation achieve?
			
			PERSONLISATION
=============

Personalisation is the future. By explicitly addressing your invitations to "Sarah, Jane & Jenny", it takes the guesswork away from your guests: Sarah knows straight away that she can bring her flatmate and daughter. If it just says "Sarah & Guest", she knows she is invited and can bring any guest. An invitation that isn'tpersonalised makes it awkward for your guests to know who they can and can't bring along (and awkward for you
to know who they are bringing along too), but if you address your guests individually, you'll make things
easier for yourself and your guests from the start: it avoids that difficult conversation when they ask you,
"Can I bring the kids/boyfriend I met last week?".

If you don't personalise your wedding invitations with individual names, it's not clear who exactly is invited--and that means more hassle for you.

But handwriting guest names on each invitation is also a messy, time consuming , physically demanding (your hand will ache after a while and the beautiful handwriting you inscribed on the first invitation will start looking like a Doctor's signature by invitation number 32) and error prone (no delete button when you mess up the spelling, and oh dear, the name won't fit in the space!). 

Ink smudges easily, and in the words of one of our brides, "I just don't ike the look of a perfect printed invitation and then hand written names".

But there's a simple solution: We can print your guest names on each invitation individually, as well as addressing your envelopes (more info below): not only does it look much nicer to have an invitation co-ordinated with pre-printed names, but creating a list you can edit and update on a computer first is much more manageable. And whilst there is always the (very expensive) option of a professional calligrapher, you can also choose something called "Handwriting fonts" which can mimic the effect of calligraphic written names with a special font but without the expensive hassle.

And to top it all off you can add via user interface.


Save time, avoid damaging the invitation by writing on envelope or card, less mistakes.


Important so people know who is invited! Specific names.
Guest names on invitations... handwriting can look horrible so better to have a calligrapher or the names
printed - ballpoint pen can imprint on the card and smudge etc

"I just don't like the look of a perfect, printed invitation and then hand written names"
Easier to have a list you can edit and update on the computer
Less likely to make mistakes, very easy to when you are handwriting
Handwriting is timeconsuming and you get handache--physically demanding
Handwriting font can be used to mimic handwriting for the personal effect
Looks more co-ordinated--in the same font
Letters to special guests that are signed--a signature is often a good way of doing things, but this can even
be scanned in to save time

			
			DON'T THINK DOING IT YOURSELF WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY
			==========================================================
			
			Have you ever done a simple DIY job around the house that's turned into a large DIY job that's cost you more in time, money and frustration than if you'd just paid a professional to do it? Beware of the false economy of making invitations yourself. If you're going to do things properly, you're going to need at least some of the following:
			
			* guillotine
			* a card scorer
			* a decent printer and ink 
			* a lot of time
			- Cost and time in the longrun can outweight the benefits of doing things yourself.
- ALl the equipment you need: glue, guillotine, ribbon scissors (normal scissors tear)...
- end up costing more and turning out less professional. How well can you tie ribbons without equipment?
=Things don't turn out how you want them to--better to see a photo of the finished product. ALso the cost of
buying things to try out your own designs, getting colours to match.

			
			"What cost me money is not so much doing the actual invites, it was what I bought to try it out before I decided what I wanted it to look like!"
			
			
			What happens when the card is too thick to go through your printer? 
			What about when the ink doesn't print correctly on your textured card? What about when ever other envelope jams in your printer?

			BAD TYPESETTING
===========
Don't let your invitation look like it was created in Microsoft Word.


Don't let ugly typesetting make your invitations amateurish and tacky: sometimes when you look at something, it
just looks professional, chic and expensive but if anyone was to ask you, you wouldn't be able to explain
why--it's just a feeling. But a lot of work goes into making you have that feeling: it's all in the detail--
care and attention to the little things that, on their own don't seem very significant but combined make a
massive difference to the way people see and perceive your invitations--either as cheap and tacky or expensive
and elegant.

Subtle touches such as careful alignment and spacing, the use of bullet points and ornamental separations
between paragraphs, may not sound like much but they all add up to create a stunning layout that you would
expect from a Royal invitation. You won't get the same degree of

 Free fonts that have been downloaded from the internet are free for a reason: they don't have the same
refinements that will give your invitations a polished, superior look.


Difference between a newspaper like The Sun and The Times? Or between Lidl and Waitrose?



INK
===
wax ink is waterproof and colours remain solid not washed out as it is not soluble. Great in transit.

Poor print quality. flawless

The ink is effectively indelible. Even with a page hot off the printer I can't intentionally smear the ink.

We use a printing method known as solid ink: what it means for your invitations is that the print has a slightly raised quality--if you run your finger over the card you can actually feel where the ink is raised--and the colours and printing are identical regardless of the type or colour of card you are using. Blacks are sharp and clear, colours are vibrant and bright. See what Wikipedia says about solid ink printing:
Use a sheet of vellum that is used tastefully to separate cards and avoid the ink imprinting on other surfaces.


REPLY CARDS
===========
Your guests are human, and like most humans, they're more likely to do something if it's easy and pain-free.
That's why reply cards are important&mdash;no reply cards means no replies: and no replies means, among the
other 101 things you need to do, you're going to have the hassle of chasing your guests to find out who is, or
isn't, coming. A pre-addressed reply card increases your chances of getting responses quickly as it is very
easy for your guests just tick a box and post the card. Invitations with reply cards get four times as many
responses as invitations without.


RSVP cards should have the names of the guests on so you know who is replying--often guests will neglect to
write their names in
stamp reply cards to ensure they are posted

SAFETY IN TRANSIT
=================

-- Delivered (and damaged) by Royal Mail

Ever wondered what happens to your invitations when they go in the post box? Does a magic fairy with clean hands magically fly them to their destination? No. They are handled by at least a dozen different people, pressed between rollers, rained-upon and X-rayed&mdash;just for starters. 

ENVELOPES
=========
- Personalised with guest name and address. When handwriting you can smudge, make errors, imprint through to
the other side.
- Matching design which really stands out and coordinates--your guests will want to keep it



Opening an invitation is an experience. The envelope is the most important part of that experience:  it's the first thing your guests will see and when it arrives through the letterbox and you want them to be impressed and excited to find out what's inside, and not think it's another badly-written birthday card from Aunty Emily.

The envelopes in our collection are highly unusual in that they are handmade-to-order, printed inside and out with matching, intricate designs that compliment the invitations they contain, along with your chosen monogram. Each envelope can also be individually addressed with your guest names and addresses.

			
CO-ORDINATION
=============
Coordination.

Every item of your stationery should match.  Would you wear tracksuit bottoms with a shirt and tie? Nothing screams unprofessional like a venue map on an information sheet that's been cut and pasted from Google Maps.


EXPERIENCE
==========
Box envelopes -- protects embellishments during transit, feels more like a gift -- mention horror story of
diamante pearl breaking through envelope
Tactile - paper texture and weight, solid ink printing is slightly raised and stays the same colour regardless
of material

EMBELLISHMENTS
=============
Embellishments -- ribbon, the process of "unwrapping"", untying the ribbon, the feel of the embellishment--
plastic or heavy metal, diamante

Not a glossy wedding invitation that looks like a greeting card from Moonpig
Colour, theme, fonts--"feel of wedding2
Co-ordination, consistency between all items
All of this is missing from Facebook invites/e-invites, plus keepsake, and possibility of email not being
received or going into spam
Quality of typography, small nuances


MEMORIES
========
Letters to accompany invitations for special someone
Keepsake--people don't throw them in the bin--To give friends and family, and yourself, a keepsake of your day
to treasure and remember
--We provide one invitation in a special box with tissue paper for you to keep as your own keepsake, hand down
to children


WORDING
=======
Style of wording--informal and fun or traditional and serious
Wedding abroad - invitation poems - asking for money, gifts - gift list



PREPARATION
===========
How far in advance do you send wedding invitations?
Making sure postage is correct
Order a few more envelopes or invitations than you need
Time scales of RSVP
Make sure your hands are clean and the area you are assembling the invitations in is clean
Organise your guest list. Remember you don't need one invitation per guest, this way peopel sometimes
overestimate the number of invitationst ehy will need
Double check spelling of names (Micheal not Michael is a common one!) and typos
Check the weight of the invitation because otherwise you could not be putting ont he correct postage-we will
tell you the postage you need, we can also pre-stamp the invitations
Return address for reply cards
Handwriting names and addresses--don't press too hard, don't have cards underneath one another or other guests
will see other names imprinted, use ink that is less likely to smudge and a good quality pen. Calligrapher is
an option. Best option is to print names though as these will match completely

INFORMATION SHEET
=================
where's the venue? They'll need the postcode for their sat-nav, otherwise you and your bridesmaids are going to
have the joy of answering twenty phone calls on the morning of your wedding as lost guests phone you when
they've gone up the wrong country lane. What do they wear? Explaining the dress code is important if you don't
want Auntie Edna turning up in that bright puce dress with the ostentatious hat. Can children come? Can they
give vouchers or money instead of buying you another garlic press? The number of details you provide is
inversely proportional to the stress you'll experience (the more details you give, less stress for you!).
Sometimes it's even worth providing an additional instruction leaflet for all the extra stuff.
- reduce your stress for you by providing guests with all the information they need about your big day so they
don't have to hassle you with questions at the last minute

The packaging is as important as the gift inside
=============================

Nothing lets a good invitation down like a bad envelope: Isn't there something satisfying about opening a perfectly-wrapped present, tied with a bow and adorned with a tag? That's why companies spend millions of pounds wrapping things like rice in elegant, carefully-designed foil (and shoving an extra £1 on the price in the process!). Needless to say, boring, plain envelopes with smudged, hand-scribbled addresses will not do justice to what is inside.The envelope is the first thing your guests will see and when it arrives through the letterbox you want them to be impressed and excited to find out what's inside, and not think it's another badly-written birthday card from Aunty Emily or a bill from British Gas.

Envelopes are wrongly the least considered element of an invitation package: but we believe they are just as important as every other item. That's why we handmake them to order, printed inside and out with matching, intricate designs that compliment the invitations they contain, along with your chosen monogram. Each envelope can also be individually addressed with your guest names and addresses for the ultimate co-ordination. 

Box envelopes are even better.


Your invitation isn't a card. It is a gift. 
========================

Your invitations aren't council tax bills or Christmas cards&mdash;they are keepsakes for you, your family and your guests to treasure forever: something to pass down to your children and grandchildren. They're just as important as the photographs when it comes to a record of your special day.

Opening an invitation should be like opening a gift for the guest who receives it: the honour that you have chosen them to attend your wedding is no small gesture but one of great meaning.

Have you ever opened an expensive box of chocolates? 

First there's the cellophane wrapping, then feeling for the tabs to open the cardboard lid. Usually there's a layer of light corrugated card to lift up underneath which each chocolate sits in its own unique shape on the carefully moulded tray. Some chocolates are individually wrapped in foil, and of course there is the little instruction booklet too. 

All of those things add to the pleasure and experience of eating the chocolate&mdash;it's such a different experience than putting your fingers into a bag of minstrels. 

Our invitations are the same.

First, there is a range of embellishments to add that wow factor. Whether it's gently removing the paper wrap adorned with your monogram, removing the gently glinting diamante buckle or untying the bow, your guests will feel like they're engaging with something special. 

Then there's the delicate, frosted vellum cover, again watermarked with your monogram in a matching design, that evokes a feeling of exclusivity than card alone cannot match.

And the pièce de résistance: the beautifully printed tissue paper, light as a feather, used to separate any inserts such as RSVP cards or information sheets that may be enclosed with your invitation. If you opt for a box envelope (read more in a bit...) then these are layered either side of your invitation card: it really does feel like opening a box containing an expensive pair of designer shoes. 

And not only does the tissue add an angelic beauty, it also serves the practical function of preventing the ink imprinting during transit.
