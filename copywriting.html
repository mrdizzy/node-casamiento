* Choose any colour and font

 - Not limited to three or four colours so you can match and co-ordinate your existing theme or choose your favourite colours. Take any design and make it whatever colour you choose. Make it unique to you. Complete control over how things will look. 
 
* Print yourself 
- Can choose the type and colour of card or paper you want to print on. You can make last minute changes. You can see how the colours look on paper and change them to get exact matches rather than just looking on a screen as colours and designs look different on screen. If a new guest decides to come at the last minute or you realise a guest name is spelled incorrectly you can quickly print another card. No waiting for delivery. You could add your own embellishments and if you make mistakes you can just reprint--be creative with the designs. Control over everything. 

Adjust font size. 
- Some guest names are long and some guest names are short and you can tailor each place card so that the names look right on each card. Makes cards better looking. Stops mistakes from happening like names being cut off. 

* Print straight from the browser
-- Very Fast. No waiting for PDFs to download or downloading or installing programs. Access from any computer and print from any computer as long as there is an internet connection - say you need to use your work printer. 

* Enter your own names
- Faster and less hassle. You can see the list of names all in one place so you know which guests are missing.  Copy and paste an existing list. Less hassle trying to write them onto each card--no mistakes--less time-consuming. 

* Instant changes, no loading
No waiting around for graphics to reload every time a colour changes. 

* Save your inputs automatically


* Different designs
- Fits around your theme--party, wedding, corporate, traditional. 

* Fast delivery 
- No waiting around so you can see results fast. Less worry.
