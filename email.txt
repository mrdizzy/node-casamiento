Thanks a lot for your order! I will need the following from you: 

- The design you would like. There are lots of designs to choose from and these are shown on the listing. 

- A list of guest names to be printed on each card. You can send these via email or via eBay messages. Please put one guest name on each line. They will be printed exactly as you type them so make sure capital letters are in the right places!

- Your choice of colours. There are lots and lots of colours to choose from and they are shown on the listing. Please note that we cannot print metallic colours such as silver or gold--these would print as yellow and grey.  

- Your choice of monogram. Again, monogram styles are also shown on the listing. We will need to know the names you wish to use for the monogram (e.g. "Charlie & Anna") and also the date and location of the venue (e.g. "21st August 2013" and "St Edmunds Castle, Edinburgh"). 

Your cards will be despatched within 5 days from receiving all of your choices. 

If you have any questions please let me know and I will answer them for you. 

Thanks again, 

David
